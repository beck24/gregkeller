            text: 'The provincial funding model is inadequate to support the needs of a complex district like ours. As a district with significant socio-economic challenges, we have a substantial number of students who live in poverty and/or who have complex learning or support needs. Further, we are starting to realize that perhaps the biggest impact that COVID has had on students is mental health and the supports that are required to assist students entering the school system who have not had the opportunity to experience this type of learning environment.'

We need to ensure that we support each student’s unique needs and learning styles. We also need to ensure that students have access to appropriate learning aids and materials and that these items are provided free of charge to all students.'

Through this enhanced process which factors in development potential based on local government planning regulations, the district is now projecting significant growth in the next decade. If the projections hold true, our schools will be 25% over capacity by 2030 overall with some schools as much as 94% over capacity. This poses a significant challenge given the nature of how school capacity is added and the costs involved.'

As a result of the provincial funding model, the district is forced to be reactionary versus proactive in terms of maintenance. Our FCI score is 0.434. It is important to note any score greater than 0.3 indicates that the facility has critical needs. It has been suggested that the district has tens of millions of dollars of deferred maintenance required to lower our overall FCI score to 0.3.'
