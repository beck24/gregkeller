            text: 'Want to support our campaign, but are unable to door knock, attend an event, or hand out promotional materials? Consider making a donation. All donations made online are recorded and collected in accordance with the Local Elections Campaign Financing Act. Lets face it, running an election campaign is time-consuming and expensive. While I am funding the campaign to the maximum allowable limit, I am seeking donations from community members to stretch our campaign dollars further. Your donations will help fund handouts, lawn signs, and advertising that is critical to the success of our campaign.'
